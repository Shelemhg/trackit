# Overview

Trackit is a web application designed to help users track Amazon product prices efficiently.

To get started with Trackit, you can run a test server on your local machine, you just need to:

1. Clone this repository to your computer.
2. Navigate to the "client" directory in your terminal.
3. Run the following command to start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```


4. Open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access the Home page of the app.

The purpose of developing Trackit is to create a user-friendly platform where individuals can track the prices of their favorite Amazon products. It's designed to help users save money and stay updated on product price changes and trends.

You can watch a demonstration of Trackit on YouTube, where I provide a 5 minute video where I show the navigation through the web pages as well as a code walkthrough.

# Web Pages

Trackit consists of the following web pages:

1. Home Page: This is the landing page where users are introduced to the app's purpose and can get started with tracking Amazon product prices.
2. Login Page: Users can log in to their accounts to access their personalized watchlists.

The app transitions between these pages to provide a seamless user experience.

# Development Environment

During the development of Trackit, I used:

- React: The front-end of the web application is built using the React library, allowing for efficient and responsive user interfaces.
- React Router: To handle client-side routing and page navigation.
- CSS: Custom styling and layout were implemented using Cascading Style Sheets.
- Node.js: The development server is powered by Node.js, enabling server-side functionality.
- npm: The Node Package Manager was used to manage project dependencies and run scripts.

# Useful Websites

Hats off to Codrkai on Youtube, for their awesome explanations from the ground up and the thorough and clear explanations. He is an amazing teacher in a digital ocean of horrible attempts to teach coding.

# Future Work

In the future, I plan to enhance Trackit by adding:

1. User Authentication with Auth0: Implement secure user authentication and registration to ensure data privacy and user-specific tracking.
2. Enhanced Product Tracking: Allow users to import their Amazon wish lists or provide product URLs for tracking.
3. Price Alerts: Set up email and mobile notifications for price drops and increases.
4. User Profiles: Enable users to create profiles with personalization options and preferences.
5. Improved Data Visualization: Implement charts and graphs to help users visualize price trends over time.
6. Expand Product Data: Include more comprehensive product details and reviews from Amazon's API.
